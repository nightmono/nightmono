Hello! I'm a beginner Python programmer with an interest in software enginnering, full-stack, and Linux. 

I also enjoy a bit of scripting, game dev, and exploring random bits of tech I see every now and then. Always open to learn new stuff too! (Hit me up with a field/subject you're studying/working in if you want!)
